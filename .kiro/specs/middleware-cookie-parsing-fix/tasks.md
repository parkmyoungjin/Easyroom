# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement AuthCookieManager for proper cookie validation and management





  - Create src/lib/auth/AuthCookieManager.ts with cookie validation methods that check for proper JSON format
  - Implement setCookiesSafely method that uses supabase.auth.setSession() for proper cookie generation
  - Add clearCorruptedCookies method that safely clears invalid session data using Supabase client methods
  - Implement cookie format validation using regex patterns to detect malformed cookies before they cause parsing errors
  - Add comprehensive error logging that captures cookie validation failures without exposing sensitive data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.4, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Enhance AuthContext to use proper Supabase session management





  - Modify src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx to integrate AuthCookieManager for all session operations
  - Update setInitialSession method to use setCookiesSafely instead of direct cookie manipulation
  - Implement proper error handling that clears corrupted cookies and attempts session recovery using Supabase refresh methods
  - Add session verification after setting to ensure cookies are properly formatted and readable by middleware
  - Ensure all session state changes go through proper Supabase client methods to maintain cookie compatibility
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Add enhanced error handling and debugging to middleware





  - Update src/middleware.ts to add detailed logging for cookie parsing failures without breaking existing functionality
  - Implement try-catch blocks around session parsing with specific error categorization for debugging
  - Add cookie inspection logging that shows cookie names, lengths, and format validation without exposing sensitive data
  - Ensure middleware gracefully handles malformed cookies by redirecting to login instead of crashing
  - Maintain existing middleware logic while adding better error visibility for cookie-related issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Write comprehensive tests and validate authentication flow





  - Create unit tests for AuthCookieManager that verify cookie validation and generation methods work correctly
  - Write integration tests that verify complete login flow generates cookies that middleware can parse successfully
  - Test error recovery scenarios where corrupted cookies are detected and properly cleared by AuthContext
  - Add end-to-end tests that verify users can login, navigate to protected routes, and refresh pages without infinite redirects
  - Test session persistence across browser sessions and validate that authentication state remains consistent
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
