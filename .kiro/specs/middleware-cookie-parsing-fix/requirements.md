# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing a critical authentication issue where the Next.js middleware cannot properly parse Supabase session cookies, causing a "Failed to parse cookie string: SyntaxError: Unexpected token b in JSON at position 0" error. This results in an infinite redirect loop where users successfully log in on the client side but are immediately redirected back to the login page because the server-side middleware fails to recognize their authenticated state.

**Root Cause Analysis**: The issue stems from AuthContext not generating properly formatted session cookies that are compatible with the middleware's parsing logic. This violates the architectural principle that AuthContext must be the single source of truth for authentication state management across both client and server contexts.

**Architectural Constraint**: All modifications MUST be made within the established architecture, respecting AuthContext's authority and ensuring consistent authentication state management without creating bypasses or temporary workarounds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to stay logged in after successful authentication, so that I can access protected pages without being redirected back to the login page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in through AuthContext THEN it SHALL generate session cookies in the correct format that middleware can parse without JSON errors
2. WHEN AuthContext establishes a session THEN it SHALL ensure cookie data is properly serialized and compatible with server-side parsing
3. WHEN session cookies are generated by AuthContext THEN authenticated users SHALL be able to access protected routes without redirects
4. WHEN AuthContext detects authentication state changes THEN it SHALL maintain consistent cookie formatting across client and server contexts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AuthContext to generate Supabase session cookies that are fully compatible with middleware parsing, so that authentication works reliably across all routes without architectural violations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AuthContext initializes Supabase clients THEN it SHALL use the correct configuration that ensures cookie compatibility with middleware
2. WHEN AuthContext sets session cookies THEN they SHALL be formatted as valid JSON strings that middleware can parse without errors
3. WHEN AuthContext manages authentication state THEN it SHALL follow official @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs patterns for consistent cookie handling
4. WHEN AuthContext serializes session data THEN it SHALL use proper JSON.stringify() for complex objects and ensure correct encoding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AuthContext to prevent cookie parsing failures through proper generation, with graceful error handling that maintains architectural integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AuthContext generates cookies THEN it SHALL validate cookie format before setting to prevent parsing errors
2. WHEN AuthContext detects invalid session data THEN it SHALL regenerate cookies using proper Supabase patterns without bypassing established flows
3. WHEN cookie validation fails in AuthContext THEN it SHALL implement try-catch blocks and log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN AuthContext handles authentication errors THEN it SHALL clear invalid state and redirect through established routing patterns without creating infinite loops

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to work consistently across browser sessions and page refreshes, so that I don't lose my login state unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users refresh the page THEN AuthContext SHALL maintain authentication state persistence through properly formatted cookies
2. WHEN users navigate between protected routes THEN AuthContext's cookie generation SHALL ensure middleware consistently recognizes authenticated state
3. WHEN AuthContext manages sessions THEN it SHALL leverage Supabase auth-helpers library for automatic token refresh within architectural boundaries
4. WHEN users close and reopen the browser THEN AuthContext SHALL restore valid sessions through correctly formatted cookies without parsing errors
