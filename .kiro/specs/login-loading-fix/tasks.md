# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Core Authentication State Management Refactoring





  - Refactor useAuth hook to implement centralized authentication state management with proper loading states and error handling
  - Remove duplicate redirect logic from useAuth hook and consolidate authentication state updates
  - Add proper initialization flags and loading state management to prevent race conditions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Fix Login Form Redirect Logic



  - Remove conflicting redirect logic from LoginForm component that uses both window.location.href and router.push
  - Implement single, reliable post-login redirect mechanism using Next.js router
  - Add proper loading state management during login process with timeout handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Implement Centralized Navigation Controller






  - Create a centralized navigation controller that handles all post-authentication redirects
  - Implement logic to determine correct redirect path based on user role and previous page
  - Add fallback mechanisms for when primary redirect fails
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Add Timeout and Error Recovery Mechanisms






  - Implement timeout detection for login process (10 seconds) and redirect process (5 seconds)
  - Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options when timeouts occur
  - Create fallback redirect mechanisms when primary navigation fails
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.2, 1.3_

- [x] 5. Enhance Loading State Management






  - Replace generic loading spinner with specific progress indicators showing current step
  - Add timeout detection for loading states that exceed expected duration
  - Implement user options for manual refresh when loading exceeds 30 seconds
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Fix Page Content Loading Issues






  - Update PageContent component to handle authentication state changes more reliably
  - Remove unnecessary loading states that cause infinite loading loops
  - Implement proper mounting and authentication state synchronization
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 7. Add Comprehensive Error Handling






  - Implement centralized error handler for authentication and navigation errors
  - Add detailed logging for debugging authentication flow issues
  - Create user-friendly error messages with actionable recovery steps
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 8. Implement Network Connection Monitoring




  - Add network connection status detection during authentication process
  - Display appropriate messages when network issues are detected
  - Provide retry mechanisms for network-related failures
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

- [ ] 9. Create Integration Tests for Login Flow
  - Write integration tests that verify complete login-to-redirect flow works correctly
  - Test various user roles and their respective redirect destinations
  - Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 10. Add Performance Monitoring and Debugging
  - Add performance metrics tracking for login and redirect timing
  - Implement debug logging that can be enabled for troubleshooting
  - Create monitoring for authentication flow success/failure rates
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_
