# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AuthContext is experiencing an infinite loop issue where session polling continuously calls `setInitialSession()` when the authentication status is 'unauthenticated'. This creates excessive logging, performance degradation, and potential memory leaks. The system needs to implement intelligent session polling that prevents infinite loops while maintaining PWA functionality for magic link authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to stop infinite session polling, so that the application performs efficiently without excessive logging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication status is 'unauthenticated' THEN the system SHALL not continuously poll for sessions
2. WHEN session polling is active THEN it SHALL have a maximum retry limit to prevent infinite loops
3. WHEN session polling fails multiple times THEN it SHALL exponentially back off and eventually stop
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL check for session only once initially unless explicitly triggered

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want magic link authentication to work reliably in PWA environments, so that I can log in seamlessly from email links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a magic link THEN the system SHALL detect the authentication change within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the user is on the login page THEN the system SHALL poll for authentication changes with intelligent timing
3. WHEN the user navigates away from login page THEN session polling SHALL stop immediately
4. WHEN the app regains focus on login page THEN it SHALL check for session once without starting continuous polling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for session management, so that authentication errors are handled gracefully without infinite retries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN session refresh fails THEN the system SHALL not retry more than 3 times
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff before retrying
3. WHEN session errors are permanent THEN the system SHALL stop retrying and show appropriate error message
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN error states SHALL be cleared appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to be responsive and not cause performance issues, so that the application remains fast and usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication system is running THEN it SHALL not cause excessive console logging
2. WHEN session polling is active THEN it SHALL use efficient timing intervals (not every 1 second continuously)
3. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN session polling SHALL stop completely
4. WHEN memory cleanup is needed THEN all intervals and event listeners SHALL be properly cleared
