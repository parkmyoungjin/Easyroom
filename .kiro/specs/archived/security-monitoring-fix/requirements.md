# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical TypeScript compilation error in the security monitoring system where there's a type mismatch between `SecurityEventContext` and `SecurityEvent` interfaces. The error occurs when trying to record security events through the `securityMonitor.recordEvent()` method, which expects a `type` property but receives `eventType` from the `SecurityEventContext` interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the security monitoring system to compile without TypeScript errors, so that the build process succeeds and the application can be deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security monitoring system records an event THEN the TypeScript compiler SHALL NOT produce type mismatch errors
2. WHEN `SecurityEventContext` is passed to `securityMonitor.recordEvent()` THEN the interface SHALL be compatible with the expected `SecurityEvent` type
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL complete successfully without security monitoring type errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent type interfaces across the security monitoring system, so that there's no confusion between different event context types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining security event interfaces THEN the property names SHALL be consistent across all related types
2. WHEN using security event contexts THEN the interface SHALL clearly indicate whether it's for input or output
3. WHEN extending security event types THEN the base interface SHALL be reusable across different contexts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the security monitoring to continue functioning correctly after the type fix, so that security events are properly tracked and recorded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security event occurs THEN it SHALL be recorded with all required properties
2. WHEN the security monitor processes events THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality
3. WHEN security alerts are triggered THEN they SHALL contain accurate event information
