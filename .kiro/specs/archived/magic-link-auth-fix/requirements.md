# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical Magic Link authentication failure in the Supabase authentication system. Users are experiencing authentication failures where the magic link callback receives the authentication code and token information but fails to establish a session, resulting in repeated retry attempts and eventual failure. This impacts user experience and prevents successful login through email-based authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully authenticate using magic links sent to my email, so that I can access the application without password-based login.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a magic link from their email THEN the system SHALL successfully exchange the authentication code for a valid session
2. WHEN the authentication callback processes the code THEN the system SHALL create and store a session within the first attempt
3. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the appropriate authenticated page
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and debugging capabilities in the authentication flow, so that I can quickly identify and resolve authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including the specific failure reason
2. WHEN token exchange fails THEN the system SHALL capture and log the exact error response from Supabase
3. WHEN session creation fails THEN the system SHALL log the session state and relevant configuration
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to handle edge cases and network issues gracefully, so that temporary issues don't permanently block user access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network issues occur during token exchange THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN Supabase service is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users
3. WHEN authentication state is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover or clear the state appropriately
4. WHEN multiple authentication attempts occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle them without conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication process to work consistently across different browsers and devices, so that I can access the application from any platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using different browsers THEN the magic link authentication SHALL work consistently
2. WHEN cookies or localStorage are restricted THEN the system SHALL still maintain authentication state
3. WHEN the callback URL is accessed directly THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without errors
4. WHEN authentication state expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication clearly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation of the Supabase configuration and environment setup, so that configuration issues are identified before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required Supabase configuration parameters
2. WHEN environment variables are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN Supabase project settings are misconfigured THEN the system SHALL detect and report the specific issues
4. WHEN redirect URLs are not properly configured THEN the system SHALL identify and suggest corrections
