# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature optimizes the existing PWA authentication redirection system by reducing implementation complexity while maximizing stability. The core focus is on channel unification, flow simplification, and enhanced user experience safety mechanisms. The optimization maintains the essential functionality of the current PWA authentication redirection design while addressing key pain points in complexity and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the PWA authentication system, I want a unified state management channel so that I can reduce code complexity and ensure consistent behavior across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL use only localStorage polling-based Universal Auth State Manager for state synchronization
2. WHEN BroadcastChannel functionality is needed THEN the system SHALL handle it through the unified localStorage mechanism
3. WHEN external app authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL detect state changes through the same localStorage polling mechanism
4. IF BroadcastChannel exists in the current implementation THEN the system SHALL remove it and replace with localStorage-based communication
5. WHEN state management occurs THEN the system SHALL apply consistent logic across all browser environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user authenticating through external apps, I want a simplified redirection flow so that I can reliably return to the PWA without platform-specific complications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication completes in external app THEN the system SHALL redirect to standard PWA web URLs instead of custom URL schemes
2. WHEN redirection occurs THEN the system SHALL store authentication state in localStorage for PWA synchronization
3. WHEN PWA launches after authentication THEN the system SHALL read localStorage to determine login state
4. IF deep links (custom URL schemes) exist in current implementation THEN the system SHALL remove them from the primary authentication flow
5. WHEN authentication state synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL not depend on platform-specific configurations
6. WHEN redirection fails THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication state in localStorage for manual recovery

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user completing authentication, I want reliable fallback options so that I can always return to the PWA even when automatic redirection fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication completes THEN the system SHALL display a Smart Verified Page with a visible "Return to App" button
2. WHEN automatic redirection fails THEN the user SHALL have access to manual return options
3. WHEN the "Return to App" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL navigate the user back to the PWA
4. WHEN the Smart Verified Page loads THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic redirection while simultaneously showing manual options
5. IF automatic redirection succeeds THEN the manual button SHALL remain available as backup
6. WHEN network issues or browser settings prevent automatic redirection THEN the user SHALL still be able to complete the authentication flow manually

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication optimization to maintain backward compatibility so that existing user sessions and authentication flows continue to work during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the optimization is deployed THEN existing authenticated users SHALL remain logged in
2. WHEN legacy authentication tokens exist THEN the system SHALL recognize and validate them
3. WHEN users have pending authentication flows THEN the system SHALL complete them successfully
4. IF migration from old to new system occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve user authentication state
5. WHEN the new system activates THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle any remaining BroadcastChannel or deep link references

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer testing the authentication system, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can quickly identify and resolve any issues with the optimized authentication flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN localStorage polling fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and attempt recovery
2. WHEN redirection attempts fail THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and activate fallback mechanisms
3. WHEN authentication state becomes inconsistent THEN the system SHALL detect and correct the inconsistency
4. WHEN Smart Verified Page loads THEN the system SHALL log redirection attempts and their outcomes
5. IF any component of the authentication flow fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to users and detailed logs for developers
