- [x] 2. Build Smart Verified Page Component and Migration Script





  - Create Smart Verified Page React component with automatic redirection and manual return button
  - Implement configurable auto-redirect delay and comprehensive fallback mechanisms
  - Develop one-time migration script with startup detection of old auth state format
  - Add detailed logging for redirection attempts, outcomes, and migration processes
