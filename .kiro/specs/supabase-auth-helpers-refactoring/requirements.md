# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive refactoring of the Supabase client creation logic throughout the application to use @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs. The current implementation has inconsistent client creation patterns where the client-side uses auth-helpers but server-side components still use legacy createClient methods, causing 401 Unauthorized errors due to improper cookie handling and session management.

The refactoring will establish a unified, context-aware client creation system that properly handles authentication across all Next.js 13+ App Router execution contexts (client components, server components, API routes, and server actions).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified Supabase client creation system that works consistently across all Next.js execution contexts, so that authentication state is properly maintained throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Supabase clients in different contexts THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate auth-helper function for each context
2. WHEN a client component needs a Supabase client THEN the system SHALL use createBrowserClient from auth-helpers
3. WHEN a server component needs a Supabase client THEN the system SHALL use createServerClient with proper cookie handling
4. WHEN an API route needs a Supabase client THEN the system SHALL use createRouteHandlerClient with request/response context
5. WHEN a server action needs a Supabase client THEN the system SHALL use createServerClient with cookie handling for server actions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication session to persist correctly across all parts of the application, so that I don't encounter 401 errors when accessing authenticated features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am logged in and access API routes THEN the system SHALL properly read my authentication cookies and maintain my session
2. WHEN I navigate between client and server components THEN my authentication state SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN I perform server actions THEN my authentication context SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN I access the reservations API endpoint THEN the system SHALL correctly identify my authenticated status
5. IF I am not authenticated THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 401 responses with clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized helper files for each execution context, so that I can easily import the correct client creation function for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing client creation logic THEN the system SHALL provide separate helper files for each context
2. WHEN working with client components THEN developers SHALL import from src/lib/supabase/client.ts
3. WHEN working with server components THEN developers SHALL import from src/lib/supabase/server.ts
4. WHEN working with API routes or server actions THEN developers SHALL import from src/lib/supabase/actions.ts
5. WHEN importing helper functions THEN each file SHALL export clearly named functions with proper TypeScript types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate existing code systematically, so that all authentication-related functionality continues to work after the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring existing API routes THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API interface while updating internal client creation
2. WHEN updating server components THEN the authentication logic SHALL continue to work without breaking existing functionality
3. WHEN migrating server actions THEN form submissions and data mutations SHALL continue to work properly
4. WHEN replacing legacy createClient calls THEN the system SHALL ensure no functionality is lost
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing authentication flows SHALL work without modification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples for each client type, so that future development follows the correct patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating helper files THEN each function SHALL include detailed JSDoc comments explaining its purpose and usage
2. WHEN documenting client creation THEN the system SHALL provide examples for each execution context
3. WHEN explaining the refactoring THEN documentation SHALL include migration guides for each component type
4. WHEN providing usage examples THEN the system SHALL show proper import statements and function calls
5. WHEN documenting best practices THEN the system SHALL explain when to use each client type

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely remove legacy code after migration, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all components are migrated THEN the system SHALL identify which legacy files can be safely removed
2. WHEN removing legacy code THEN the system SHALL ensure no remaining references exist
3. WHEN cleaning up imports THEN the system SHALL update all import statements to use new helper functions
4. WHEN verifying the migration THEN the system SHALL provide a checklist to test all authentication flows
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the codebase SHALL only use auth-helpers-based client creation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the reservation system to work properly after the refactoring, so that I can view my reservations and create new ones without authentication errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the reservations API endpoint THEN the system SHALL properly authenticate my request using the new client creation method
2. WHEN I view my reservations list THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch my data without 401 errors
3. WHEN I create a new reservation THEN the server action SHALL properly handle my authenticated session
4. WHEN I navigate the reservation flow THEN all authentication checks SHALL work consistently
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and redirect appropriately
