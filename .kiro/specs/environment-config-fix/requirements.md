# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical environment variable configuration issues that are preventing proper email duplicate checking functionality in the test server environment. The system currently fails to initialize the Supabase client due to missing NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL environment variable, which blocks user registration and email validation processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to properly load environment variables in all deployment environments, so that the Supabase client can initialize correctly and support user authentication features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that all required environment variables are present
2. IF NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is missing THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message with troubleshooting guidance
3. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the system SHALL log successful initialization without exposing sensitive values
4. IF environment configuration fails THEN the system SHALL prevent application startup with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to check if my email is already registered during the signup process, so that I can choose a different email if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an email during registration THEN the system SHALL check for duplicates in real-time
2. IF the email already exists THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
3. WHEN email validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL allow the user to proceed with registration
4. IF the Supabase client fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message instead of crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust environment configuration management across different deployment environments (development, test, production), so that the application works consistently everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to test environment THEN the system SHALL use test-specific environment variables
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use production environment variables
3. IF environment variables are misconfigured THEN the system SHALL provide environment-specific troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL validate configuration compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for environment and Supabase client initialization failures, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variable loading fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. IF Supabase client initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error codes and resolution steps
3. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL prevent cascading failures in dependent components
4. IF multiple environment issues exist THEN the system SHALL report all issues simultaneously rather than failing on the first one
