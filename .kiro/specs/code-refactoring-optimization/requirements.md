# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive code refactoring and optimization of an existing Next.js application with Supabase backend. The system already has high-quality data integrity, security, and test coverage, but requires systematic improvements to strengthen data consistency, standardize security monitoring, optimize performance, and automate deployment processes. The goal is to enhance existing strengths while preventing potential error points and maximizing system stability through automation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Integrity Enhancement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust data integrity safeguards at both code and database levels, so that user_id and auth_id confusion issues are prevented at the source rather than fixed reactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database write operation involving user identification occurs THEN the system SHALL validate user IDs using type guards before execution
2. WHEN invalid user ID formats are detected THEN the system SHALL reject the operation and log the attempt
3. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL prevent data insertion and return meaningful error messages
4. IF user_id and auth_id confusion occurs THEN the database triggers SHALL automatically prevent inconsistent data states
5. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN the system SHALL distinguish between AuthId and DatabaseUserId types to catch errors at compile time

### Requirement 2: Security and Monitoring Standardization

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want consistent security monitoring across all application components, so that all environment variable access and critical operations are tracked and logged centrally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component accesses environment variables THEN the system SHALL route through the centralized EnvironmentSecurityManager
2. WHEN security events occur (login failures, unauthorized access attempts) THEN the system SHALL log events through SecurityMonitor
3. WHEN performance-critical operations execute THEN the system SHALL measure and report execution times
4. WHEN suspicious activities are detected THEN the system SHALL generate immediate alerts and notifications
5. IF direct process.env access is attempted THEN the system SHALL prevent it and enforce centralized access patterns

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want fast and responsive application performance, so that data loading, navigation, and interactions feel smooth and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex data queries are needed THEN the system SHALL utilize Supabase RPC functions to minimize client-server overhead
2. WHEN data fetching hooks are used THEN the system SHALL implement consistent caching strategies with optimized staleTime and gcTime
3. WHEN API endpoints receive requests THEN the system SHALL validate inputs using zod schemas before processing
4. WHEN list data is requested THEN the system SHALL support pagination with limit and offset parameters
5. WHEN retry logic is needed THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff strategies consistently across all hooks

### Requirement 4: Deployment Automation and Stability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment pipelines with built-in safety checks, so that deployments are reliable and any issues are caught before reaching production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN the CI/CD pipeline SHALL run linting, type checking, and all tests automatically
2. WHEN deployment is initiated THEN the system SHALL verify database integrity before proceeding
3. WHEN database integrity checks fail THEN the system SHALL halt deployment and notify administrators
4. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL apply them automatically during deployment
5. WHEN production monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL run automated consistency checks daily with alert notifications

### Requirement 5: API Standardization and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent API patterns and error handling across all endpoints, so that the codebase is maintainable and debugging is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs using standardized zod schemas
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them through ReservationErrorHandler or equivalent standardized handlers
3. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL follow consistent response format patterns
4. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement it consistently across all endpoints
5. WHEN API documentation is required THEN the system SHALL maintain up-to-date endpoint specifications

### Requirement 6: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage and automated quality checks, so that code changes don't introduce regressions and system reliability is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new code is written THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve existing test coverage percentages
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL verify end-to-end user scenarios work correctly
3. WHEN database operations are tested THEN the system SHALL include data integrity validation in test suites
4. WHEN performance tests execute THEN the system SHALL verify response times meet established benchmarks
5. WHEN code quality checks run THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent coding standards and best practices
