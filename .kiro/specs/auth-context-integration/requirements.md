# Requirements Document

## Introduction

현재 애플리케이션에서 AuthContext 통합이 부분적으로만 완료되어 있어, 타입 에러와 일관성 없는 인증 패턴으로 인한 문제들이 발생하고 있습니다. 전체 코드베이스를 AuthContext 중심의 통합된 인증 시스템으로 개편하여 일관성 있고 오류 없는 인증 구조를 구축해야 합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly separated authentication architecture with distinct responsibilities, so that the system is maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components need Supabase client access THEN they SHALL use a dedicated SupabaseProvider separate from AuthContext
2. WHEN components need authentication state THEN they SHALL use AuthContext focused only on auth state management
3. WHEN components need user profile data THEN they SHALL use AuthContext with memoized values to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN only components that actually use that specific state SHALL re-render

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript errors related to authentication to be resolved, so that the code compiles without warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN middleware.ts is compiled THEN it SHALL not have any TypeScript errors about session.expires_at or unused imports
2. WHEN MagicLinkHandler.tsx is compiled THEN it SHALL not have implicit 'any' type errors for event and session parameters
3. WHEN any auth-related component is compiled THEN it SHALL have proper type definitions
4. WHEN the entire project is built THEN it SHALL compile without auth-related type errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized authentication state management, so that all components have consistent access to user data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN it SHALL provide a single AuthContext to all components
2. WHEN user authentication state changes THEN it SHALL be reflected consistently across all components
3. WHEN components need user profile data THEN they SHALL access it through the same AuthContext interface
4. WHEN authentication status changes THEN it SHALL trigger appropriate UI updates across the application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want specific and concrete error handling and loading states in the authentication system, so that users have a predictable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is loading THEN components SHALL show skeleton UI or spinner with "인증 확인 중..." message
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN components SHALL display toast notification with specific error message and retry button
3. WHEN network connection is lost THEN the system SHALL show "네트워크 연결을 확인해주세요" message and retry mechanism
4. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic refresh once, and if failed, redirect to login page with "세션이 만료되었습니다" message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to work seamlessly with existing features, so that no functionality is broken during the integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing pages are accessed THEN they SHALL continue to work with the new AuthContext system
2. WHEN existing API routes are called THEN they SHALL continue to function properly
3. WHEN existing middleware logic is executed THEN it SHALL maintain all current security features
4. WHEN existing UI components are rendered THEN they SHALL display correctly with the new auth integration
