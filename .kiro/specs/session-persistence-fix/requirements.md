# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing critical authentication issues including race conditions, infinite loading states, and session persistence failures. Console logs reveal that AuthContext initializes before SupabaseProvider is ready, causing "Supabase client or cookie manager not available" errors. Additionally, complex custom session management logic (SessionSynchronizationManager, PWASessionManager) is creating synchronization loops and preventing proper authentication state resolution.

**Root Cause Analysis**: The core issue is that the client-side authentication system uses custom complex logic while the server-side (middleware, API routes) uses @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs standard patterns. This creates incompatible cookie formats and synchronization conflicts. The solution requires complete migration to auth-helpers standard patterns on the client-side to match the server-side implementation.

**Architectural Constraint**: All modifications MUST completely replace custom session management logic with @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs standard patterns. The solution must eliminate complex synchronization managers and use the proven auth-helpers client-server integration patterns that are already working on the server-side.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want authentication to work immediately after login without infinite loading screens, so that I can access the application seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN AuthContext SHALL transition from loading to authenticated state within 2 seconds
2. WHEN AuthContext initializes THEN it SHALL wait for SupabaseProvider to be ready before checking session state
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN users SHALL see immediate UI updates without stuck loading states
4. WHEN users navigate between pages THEN authentication state SHALL remain consistent without re-authentication prompts
5. WHEN page refreshes occur THEN users SHALL maintain their authenticated state without being redirected to login

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AuthContext to use @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs standard patterns, so that client-server authentication is fully compatible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AuthContext creates Supabase clients THEN it SHALL use createPagesBrowserClient from @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN AuthContext SHALL use only the standard onAuthStateChange listener for all session management
3. WHEN session cookies are set THEN they SHALL be automatically managed by auth-helpers to ensure middleware compatibility
4. WHEN AuthContext handles authentication events THEN it SHALL NOT use custom synchronization managers or complex cookie logic
5. WHEN client-side authentication occurs THEN it SHALL produce cookies that server-side middleware can parse without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all custom session management complexity removed, so that the authentication system is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN SessionSynchronizationManager SHALL be completely removed from the codebase
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN PWASessionManager SHALL be completely removed from the codebase
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN AuthCookieManager SHALL be completely removed from the codebase
4. WHEN AuthContext manages sessions THEN it SHALL use only standard auth-helpers patterns without custom synchronization logic
5. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled through standard Supabase error handling patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper initialization order and race condition prevention, so that authentication works reliably on app startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN SupabaseProvider SHALL initialize completely before AuthContext attempts session checks
2. WHEN AuthContext useEffect runs THEN it SHALL include proper dependency arrays with supabase client to prevent stale closures
3. WHEN Supabase client is not ready THEN AuthContext SHALL wait rather than setting unauthenticated state prematurely
4. WHEN authentication state is loading THEN components SHALL show appropriate loading UI instead of flickering between states
5. WHEN initialization completes THEN there SHALL be no race conditions between provider initialization and context usage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to work consistently across all environments, so that I have a reliable experience regardless of how I access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application in PWA mode THEN authentication SHALL work identically to browser mode
2. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN authentication SHALL work without console errors or warnings
3. WHEN users access the application on different devices THEN session persistence SHALL work consistently
4. WHEN network connectivity is intermittent THEN authentication SHALL handle offline/online transitions gracefully
5. WHEN the application is deployed to production THEN authentication SHALL maintain all functionality without environment-specific issues
