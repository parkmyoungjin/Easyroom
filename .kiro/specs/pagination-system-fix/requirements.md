# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the existing pagination system for the meeting room booking application. The current implementation has TypeScript compilation errors, duplicate exports, and inconsistent type definitions that prevent the application from building successfully. The goal is to create a robust, type-safe, and standardized pagination system that works seamlessly across all data fetching scenarios including reservations, rooms, and admin user management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a working pagination system without TypeScript compilation errors, so that the application can build and deploy successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pagination hooks are imported THEN the system SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN pagination hooks are used in components THEN they SHALL provide proper type safety and IntelliSense support
3. IF there are duplicate exports THEN the system SHALL resolve them by using consistent export patterns
4. WHEN building the application THEN there SHALL be no redeclaration errors for pagination-related exports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized pagination hooks for different data types, so that I can consistently fetch paginated data across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching paginated reservations THEN the system SHALL provide hooks for both regular and infinite pagination
2. WHEN fetching paginated rooms THEN the system SHALL use the same pagination interface as other entities
3. WHEN fetching paginated admin users THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with other pagination hooks
4. IF pagination parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL sanitize them and log warnings
5. WHEN pagination state changes THEN the system SHALL automatically refetch data with new parameters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling in pagination hooks, so that the application gracefully handles API failures and network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic
3. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL handle auth-related errors appropriately
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
5. IF rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with jitter

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent query key management, so that React Query caching works optimally and data invalidation is predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating query keys THEN the system SHALL use factory functions for consistency
2. WHEN invalidating queries THEN the system SHALL provide clear key hierarchies
3. IF query parameters change THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate cache keys
4. WHEN using infinite queries THEN the system SHALL maintain separate key namespaces
5. IF authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL properly differentiate cached data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types for all pagination responses, so that I have compile-time safety and better development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using pagination hooks THEN all return types SHALL be properly typed
2. WHEN accessing pagination metadata THEN properties SHALL have correct TypeScript definitions
3. IF data types differ between endpoints THEN the system SHALL use generic types appropriately
4. WHEN using infinite queries THEN flattened data SHALL maintain proper typing
5. IF pagination configurations exist THEN they SHALL be type-safe and validated

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable pagination settings per endpoint, so that different data types can have appropriate default behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching reservations THEN the system SHALL use reservation-specific pagination defaults
2. WHEN fetching rooms THEN the system SHALL use room-specific pagination settings
3. WHEN fetching users THEN the system SHALL use user-specific pagination configuration
4. IF custom pagination settings are provided THEN they SHALL override defaults appropriately
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to safe defaults
