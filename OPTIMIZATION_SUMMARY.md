# Data Fetching Optimization Summary

## Task 6: Optimize Data Fetching with Standardized Patterns

### Overview
Successfully implemented standardized data fetching patterns across all hooks, based on the optimization patterns from `useInfinitePublicReservations`. This optimization improves performance, consistency, and maintainability of data fetching throughout the application.

### Key Optimizations Implemented

#### 1. Standardized Query Optimization Utilities (`src/lib/utils/query-optimization.ts`)

**Created comprehensive utility functions:**
- `createRetryConfig()` - Exponential backoff retry logic with smart error handling
- `createCacheConfig()` - Data-type-aware cache configuration (static, semi-static, dynamic, real-time)
- `createStandardFetch()` - Standardized fetch wrapper with logging and error handling
- `createQueryKeyFactory()` - Factory pattern for consistent query key generation
- `optimizeForDateRange()` - Performance optimization for date-range queries
- `buildQueryOptions()` - Unified query options builder

#### 2. Optimized RPC Functions (`supabase/migrations/20250122_create_optimized_rpc_functions.sql`)

**Created performance-optimized database functions:**
- `get_reservation_statistics()` - Aggregated statistics with single query
- `get_room_availability_detailed()` - Room availability with conflict details
- `get_user_reservations_detailed()` - User reservations with pagination
- `search_rooms_advanced()` - Advanced room search with filtering

**Performance indexes added:**
- `idx_reservations_user_start_time` - User reservations by date
- `idx_reservations_room_time_status` - Room availability queries
- `idx_reservations_date_status` - Date-based filtering
- `idx_users_department` - Department statistics
- `idx_rooms_search` - Full-text search on rooms

#### 3. Optimized Hooks

**useReservations.ts:**
- Applied standardized query patterns to all hooks
- Implemented date-range optimization for calendar queries
- Added RPC function for user reservations with fallback
- Optimized cache strategies based on data characteristics
- Enhanced error handling and logging

**useRooms.ts:**
- Standardized all room-related queries
- Added advanced room search with RPC function
- Implemented room availability checking with RPC
- Optimized cache times for static room data
- Added comprehensive error handling

**useReservationStatistics.ts:**
- Replaced multiple client-side queries with single RPC function
- Added query hook for statistics display
- Maintained CSV download functionality
- Optimized cache for statistics data

**useUserProfile.ts:**
- Applied standardized patterns for user profile queries
- Optimized for static data characteristics
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### Performance Improvements

#### Cache Optimization
- **Static data** (rooms, user profiles): 30-minute stale time, 1-hour garbage collection
- **Semi-static data** (user reservations): 5-minute stale time, 15-minute garbage collection  
- **Dynamic data** (public reservations, statistics): 2-minute stale time, 10-minute garbage collection
- **Real-time data** (room availability): 30-second stale time, 2-minute garbage collection

#### Date Range Optimization
- Large date ranges (>30 days): Extended cache times, limited pagination
- Small date ranges: Faster refresh, unlimited pagination
- Adaptive retry delays based on range size

#### Database Optimization
- Single RPC calls replace multiple client queries
- Server-side aggregation reduces network traffic
- Optimized indexes improve query performance
- Proper pagination for large datasets

### Error Handling Improvements

#### Smart Retry Logic
- No retries for client errors (4xx)
- Exponential backoff for server errors (5xx)
- Jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Configurable retry limits per data type

#### Enhanced Logging
- Standardized operation logging
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error context preservation
- Debug information for troubleshooting

### Consistency Improvements

#### Query Key Standardization
- Factory pattern ensures consistent key generation
- Hierarchical key structure for efficient invalidation
- Type-safe parameter handling
- Predictable cache behavior

#### Fetch Pattern Standardization
- Consistent error handling across all hooks
- Standardized logging format
- Unified performance monitoring
- Predictable loading states

### Migration Benefits

#### Developer Experience
- Consistent patterns reduce cognitive load
- Type-safe utilities prevent errors
- Comprehensive logging aids debugging
- Predictable cache behavior

#### Performance Benefits
- Reduced database load through RPC functions
- Optimized cache strategies reduce redundant requests
- Smart retry logic prevents unnecessary load
- Efficient query key management

#### Maintainability
- Centralized optimization logic
- Easy to update patterns across all hooks
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage support

### Next Steps

The standardized patterns are now ready for:
1. Application to remaining data fetching hooks
2. Integration with real-time subscriptions
3. Performance monitoring and metrics collection
4. A/B testing of cache strategies

This optimization provides a solid foundation for scalable, performant data fetching throughout the application.
